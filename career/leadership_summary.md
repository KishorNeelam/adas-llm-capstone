## AI Safety Leadership Perspective

In a real organization, AI-based ADAS systems require:

- Cross-functional collaboration between AI, safety, and hardware teams
- Clear Operational Design Domain (ODD) definition
- Controlled use of LLMs for internal assistance only
- Strong governance to comply with ISO 26262, SOTIF, and emerging EU AI Act

The focus is on risk reduction and trust, not AI novelty.
