# LLM-based RAG Overview for Automotive

This document describes how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can be used safely in automotive environments.

## Why RAG?
- Prevent hallucinations
- Restrict knowledge scope
- Improve trustworthiness

## Intended Use
- Internal engineering assistance
- Requirements understanding
- Test case reference

# LLM-based Internal Copilot for Automotive

This document describes a controlled LLM system intended for internal engineering use only.

## Intended Use Cases
- Understanding ADAS requirements
- Safety document navigation
- Test case reference

## Why Not Public Chatbots
- Hallucination risk
- Data leakage
- Lack of traceability

## Chosen Approach: RAG
Retrieval-Augmented Generation ensures:
- Answers come only from approved documents
- Reduced hallucinations
- Better auditability
