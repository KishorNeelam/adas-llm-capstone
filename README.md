# ADAS & Automotive LLM Capstone Project

## Executive Summary
This repository presents a professional capstone project focused on the design,
safety, and governance of AI-based Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS),
combined with the responsible use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automotive
engineering environments.

The project emphasizes system architecture, functional safety, and deployment
constraints rather than standalone model development.

---

## Project Objectives
- Design an end-to-end ADAS AI architecture suitable for automotive SoCs
- Analyze risks and limitations of AI perception systems
- Apply ISO 26262 and SOTIF concepts to AI-based ADAS
- Design a controlled, safety-aware LLM (RAG) system for internal automotive use
- Demonstrate technical leadership and system-level thinking

---

## Scope and Boundaries
This project intentionally:
- Focuses on architecture and safety, not model accuracy benchmarks
- Uses illustrative code to explain system behavior
- Avoids production claims or public-facing AI usage

---

## Key Topics Covered
- ADAS perception pipelines and sensor fusion
- Automotive SoC constraints (latency, power, determinism)
- Functional safety (ISO 26262) and SOTIF for AI
- Controlled LLM usage via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- AI governance and leadership considerations

---

## Intended Audience
- ADAS System Architects
- Automotive AI Technical Program Managers
- Safety and Compliance Leaders
- Semiconductor and SoC Strategy Teams

---

## Disclaimer
This project is for educational and architectural demonstration purposes only
and does not represent a production-ready automotive system.
